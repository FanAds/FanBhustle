</div><p markdown="0">The Surge S1 chipset had been an ongoing project since Xiaomi subsidiary Pinecone's establishment on October 16th, 2014.
Thanks to the new chip's lower power consumption, the Mi 5c went with a smaller 2,860 mAh battery, thus achieving a slimmer metallic body at just 7.09mm thick in return.
Simply put, don't expect the Surge S1 to match the performance of other high-end chips; it's closer to the likes of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 625 and MediaTek's Helio P20.
And of course, it's only a matter of time before Xiaomi catches up with the competition with better processes and modems.
While the Surge S1 only has China Mobile radio at the moment, Xiaomi should still pose as a serious threat to other chip makers in the developing markets.<br markdown="0"></p><p markdown="0">Shared by Engadget on February 28th, 2017<br markdown="0"></p></div><p class="" markdown="0"><br markdown="0"></p>
